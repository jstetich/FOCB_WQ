# Introduction
This Notebook analyzes FOCB's "Surface" data.
These data are pulled from long term monitoring locations around the Bay.

These are sites visited regularly by FOCB staff, either by boat or on land.  The 
focus is on warm season sampling (April through October), with roughly monthly
samples.  Earlier data from some land-based sites was collected by volunteers.

This reflects only a small portion of FOCB's monitoring program, but the surface
data provides consistent sampling history with the deepest historical record.

Tn this notebook, we look specifically at a question raised by one of our
reviewers:  Whether the TEMPERATURE and SALINITY show accelerating changes that 
we should comment on in State of Casco Bay, and whether Secchi Depth is behaving
differently inshore versus offshore.

# Load Libraries
```{r load_libraries}
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)

library(mgcv)     # For `gam()` and `gamm()` models
library(emmeans)

library(CBEPgraphics)
load_cbep_fonts()
theme_set(theme_cbep())
```

# Load Data
## Establish Folder Reference
```{r folder_refs}
sibfldnm <- 'Original_Data'
parent   <- dirname(getwd())
sibling  <- file.path(parent,sibfldnm)

dir.create(file.path(getwd(), 'figures'), showWarnings = FALSE)
```

## Primary Data
We specify column names because FOCB data has a row of names, a row of units,
then the data.  This approach is simpler than reading names from the first
row and correcting them to be R syntactic names.
```{r load_data, warning = FALSE}
fn    <- 'FOCB Surface All Current Sites With BSV Data.xlsx'
fpath <- file.path(sibling,fn)

mynames <- c('station', 'dt', 'time', 'sample_depth',
             'secchi', 'water_depth','temperature', 'salinity',
             'do', 'pctsat', 'pH', 'chl', 
             'month', 'year', 'fdom', 'bga', 
             'turbidity', 'blank', 'clouds', 'wndspd',
             'winddir'
             ) 

the_data <- read_excel(fpath, skip=2, col_names = mynames) %>%
  mutate(month = factor(month, levels = 1:12, labels = month.abb))

rm(mynames)
```

### Remove 2020 only data
```{r remove_vars}
the_data <- the_data %>%
select(-c(fdom:winddir))
```

## Add Station Names
```{r add_station_names}
fn    <- 'FOCB Monitoring Sites.xlsx'
fpath <- file.path(sibling,fn)
loc_data <- read_excel(fpath) %>%
  select(Station_ID, Station_Name) %>%
  rename(station = Station_ID,
         station_name = Station_Name)

the_data <- the_data %>%
  left_join(loc_data, by = 'station') %>%
  relocate(station_name, .after = station) %>%
  
  relocate(year, .after = dt) %>%
  relocate(month, .after = year)
```

Our data contains two stations that are not associated with locations that were 
included in our spatial data.  We can see that because when we `left_join()` by 
`station`, no `station_name` is carried over.
```{r unused_sites}
l <- the_data %>%
  group_by(station) %>%
  summarize(missing = sum(is.na(station_name))) %>%
  filter(missing > 0) %>%
  pull(station)
l
```

If we look at those records, one is represented by only a single observation,
and the other only by data from 2020.  Neither matter for the current analysis.
They will get filtered out when we select data to describe recent conditions,
and trends.
```{r show_unused_data}
the_data %>%
  filter(station %in% l)
```

## Add Day of Year Value
```{r add_doy}
the_data <- the_data %>%
  mutate(doy = as.numeric(format(dt, '%j')),
         yearf = factor (year)) %>%
  relocate(doy, .after = dt) %>%
  relocate(yearf, .after = year)
```

## Address Secchi Censored Values
```{r secchi_censored}
the_data <- the_data %>%
  mutate(secchi_2 = if_else(secchi == "BSV", water_depth, as.numeric(secchi)),
         bottom_flag = secchi == "BSV") %>%
  relocate(secchi_2, .after = secchi) %>%
  relocate(bottom_flag, .after = secchi_2)
```

## Limit Data
```{r}
the_data <- the_data %>%
  select(-c(do:chl))
```


# Create Trend Data
First, we create a tibble containing information on years in which each
station was sampled.
```{r which_years}
years_data <- the_data %>%
  group_by(station, year) %>%
  summarize(yes = ! all(is.na(temperature)),
            .groups = 'drop_last') %>%
  summarize(years = sum(yes, na.rm = TRUE),
            recent_years =  sum(yes & year > 2014, na.rm = TRUE),
            .groups = 'drop')
```

Then we identify stations with at least 10 years of data, and at least three
years of data from the last five years, and use that list to select data for
trend analysis.  Finally, we adjust the levels in the `station` and 
`station_name` variables.
```{r build_trend_data}
selected_stations <- years_data %>%
  filter(years> 9, recent_years >2) %>%
  pull(station)

trend_data <- the_data %>%
  filter(station %in% selected_stations) %>%
  mutate(station = fct_drop(station),
         station_name = fct_drop(station_name)) %>%
  mutate(station = fct_reorder(station, temperature, mean, na.rm = TRUE),
         station_name = fct_reorder(station_name, temperature, mean, na.rm = TRUE))
rm(selected_stations, years_data)
```

```{r how_many}
length(unique(trend_data$station))
```

We are reduced to  17 stations with long-term records for trend analysis.


# Check Sample Depths
```{r}
summary(the_data$sample_depth)
```
So almost all samples are from under a meter, presumably because we filtered out 
deeper water samples during data preparation.

# Analysis of Temperature
Our goal here is to identify whether there are changes in the RATE of change of 
temperature. Are temperatures increasing FASTER in recent years.

There are several modeling strategies possible here, including quadratic
models, piecewise linear models, or GAM models.  WE focus initially on
quatratic models and gam models, always in a hierarchical model context.
These hierarchical models treat stations as random factors.  We explore both 
models that also treat Years as random factors and models that do not.


## Hierarchical Polynomial Models
We start by modelling a consistent bay-wide pattern.

```{r}
lmer_t1 <- gam(temperature~ poly(year,2) + month + s(yearf, bs = 're') + 
                 s(station, bs = 're'), 
               data = trend_data)
```

```{r}
oldpar <- par(mfrow = c(2,2))
gam.check(lmer_t1)
par(oldpar)
```
Residuals are heavy tailed, but otherwise not bad.

```{r}
plot(lmer_t1)
```

So, year to year variation in temperature is close to normally distributed,
suggesting the use of a random Year term won't distort the model all that
much, but as we treat year to year variation as random, we may hide trends.
```{r}
summary(lmer_t1)
```
The non-linear term in the polynomial term is deemed not significant.  We chose
not to further explore that term via analysis of AIC, ecause tere are other 
questions of model form that may hav a larger impact on results.

First, lets drop the idea that year to year variation is in part random.  This
has the effect of treating each observation as independent, rather than
assuming that measurements collected within one year are correlated.

```{r}
lmer_t2 <- gam(temperature ~ poly(year,2) + month  + 
                 s(station, bs = 're'), 
               data = trend_data)

summary(lmer_t2)
```
The non-linear term is still not significant.

## Hierarchical GAM Models
```{r}
lmer_t3 <- gam(temperature ~ s(year, k = 4) + month  + s(yearf, bs = 're') +
                 s(station, bs = 're'), 
               data = trend_data)

summary(lmer_t3)
```
Note that the effective degrees of freedom assigned to the GAM smoother for the 
Year term is 1, suggesting a linear relationship (i.e., no acceleration of 
warming).

```{r}
lmer_t4 <- gam(temperature ~ s(year, k = 4) + month  + 
                 s(station, bs = 're'), 
               data = trend_data)

summary(lmer_t4)
```

If we granta bit morefreedom to fit every wiggle between yeas, but not fitting
a random effects term for the year, the effective degrees of freedom suggests a 
non-linear fit.  We plot the GAM to assess its shape informally.

```{r}
plot(lmer_t4)
```

So, a GAM fit suggests rate of temperature increase has either not changed
(if we treat year to year variation as partially random) or SLOWED in recent 
years, not accelerated.

## Modelling Trends within Sites
Another approach is to look at temperature changes within each site:
```{r}
lmer_t5 <- gam(temperature ~ s(year, k = 4, by = station) + month  + s(yearf, bs = 're') +
                 s(station, bs = 're'), 
               data = trend_data)

summary(lmer_t5)
```
Note that the effective degrees of freedom for statistically significant GAM 
fits are usually 1, and always under 2. Looking at the fits, these are linear or 
barely curved fits, for the most part. Large but non-significant curves at a few 
sites help obscure the larger patterns, but overall, we again see no real 
evidence for any acceleration of warming.


```{r}
plot(lmer_t5, se = FALSE)
```

While a  FEW sites show acceleration of warming, It is by no means a universal
pattern.  While most sites show little evidence for a change in rate of warming,
some show and increase, and some show a decrease. Claiming any large-scale 
pattern here appears to be a stretch.

```{r}
lmer_t6 <- gam(temperature ~ s(year, k = 4, by = station) + month  + 
                 s(station, bs = 're'), 
               data = trend_data)

summary(lmer_t6)
```

If we do NOT treat years as partially a random factor, we get more apparently
significnat non-linear (EDF > 1) trends.  But a higher proportion of sites now suggest a decrease in warming.

```{r}
plot(lmer_t6, se = FALSE)
```

# Analysis of Salinity Data
Our reviewer asked whether the number of "high salinity excursions" had 
increased lately. We suspect this may reflect changes in monitoring methods, 
rather than real changes in conditions on the water.

If that's the case, we might expect variability to change, but not means and 
medians.

```{r}
ggplot(trend_data, aes(dt, salinity)) + 
  geom_point()
```
```{r}
ann_means <- trend_data %>%
  select(station, dt, year, yearf, month, salinity) %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  summarize(across(.cols = salinity, 
                   .fns = c(mean = mean, median = median, p90 = quantile), 
                   na.rm = TRUE,
                   probs = .9,
                   .names = "sal_{.fn}"),
            .groups = 'drop') %>%
  mutate(midyear = ISOdate(year, 6, 15))

ann_means
```
```{r}
ggplot(trend_data, aes(dt, salinity)) + 
  geom_point(color = 'gray50') +
  geom_line(data = ann_means, mapping = aes(midyear, sal_median),
             size = 2, color = 'orange') +
  geom_line(data = ann_means, mapping = aes(midyear, sal_mean),
             size = 2, color = 'yellow') +
  geom_line(data = ann_means, mapping = aes(midyear, sal_p90),
             size = 2, color = 'red') +
  ylim(20, 35)
```
So, I see no evidence that statistical summaries -- even the 90th percentile --
show a change in the last few years.  This tends to support the idea that the
visually obvious change in outliers reflects better data quality, not anything
going on in the ocean.

# Analysis of Secchi Depths
The key question here was whether there are differences between inshore and 
offshore sites.

## Incorporate Regionalization
We assigned nutrient monitoring sites to regions when we chose to 
combine maps of locatiosn of FOCB and DEP nitrogen samples.  We reuse
that classification here, largely for convenience.

```{r folder_refs_2}
sibfldnm <- 'Derived_Data'
parent   <- dirname(getwd())
sibling  <- file.path(parent,sibfldnm)
```

```{r}
fn = 'combined_locations.csv'
locations <- read_csv(file.path(sibling, fn))
```


```{r}
secchi_data <- trend_data %>%
  select(-temperature, -salinity) %>%
  left_join(locations, by = c('station' = 'site'))
```

But there are too many regions, so we further simplify.

```{r}
sites_df <- secchi_data %>%
  group_by(station) %>%
  summarize(station = first(station),
            station_name = first(station_name),
            .groups = 'drop') %>%
  left_join(locations, by = c('station' = 'site')) %>%
  select(-latitude, -longitude, -source) %>%
  relocate(region, .after = station_name) %>%
  mutate(mod_region = recode(region, 
                             'Fore River' = 'Embayments',
                             'Harraseeket' = 'Embayments',
                             'New Meadows' = 'Embayments',
                             'Presumpscot Estuary' = 'Embayments',
                             'Royal River Estuary' = 'Embayments'
                             ))

xtabs(~region + mod_region, data = sites_df)
```

```{r}
tmp <- sites_df %>%
  group_by(region) %>%
  summarize(mod_region = first(mod_region))

secchi_data <- secchi_data %>%
  left_join(tmp, by = 'region')
```


```{r}
ggplot(secchi_data, aes(dt, secchi_2)) + 
  geom_point(aes(color = mod_region), alpha = 0.25)
```

### Add Seasonal Factor
```{r seasonal_f}
secchi_data <- secchi_data %>%
  mutate(season_3 =  fct_collapse(month, 
                                 Spring = c('Apr', 'May'), 
                                 Summer = c('Jun','Jul', 'Aug'),
                                 Fall   =  c('Sep', 'Oct'))) %>%
  relocate(season_3, .after = month)
```


## Modeling by Region
Our core question is whether the seasonal changes in Secchi Depth are 
more pronounced in some regions compared to others.
```{r}
lm_s1 <- lm(secchi_2 ~ season_3  * mod_region * year,
               data = secchi_data)
summary(lm_s1)
```

```{r}
lm_s2 <- step(lm_s1)
summary(lm_s2)
```

```{r}
lm_s3 <- lm(secchi_2 ~ season_3  + mod_region +  year +  
              season_3:year +
              mod_region:year,
               data = secchi_data)
summary(lm_s3)
```

That is tricky to visualize.  We will need a faceted graphic to
show different predictions by regions.

```{r}
(emtrends<- emtrends(lm_s3, ~ season_3 + mod_region , var = 'year'))
```

SO that makes it clear what is going on.  Secchi depths are declining most 
of the time in all three regions, The change is small and probably not
statistically robust in the spring.  Generally, the decline in water clarity is 
stronger in each region as you get later in the year. The strongest declines 
have been offshore.

But what I really want are the predictions, so I can make a graphic out of these 
ideas.

```{r}
(emms <- as_tibble(emmeans(lm_s3, 
                           ~ season_3 + mod_region + year, 
                           cov.keep = 'year')) %>%
  mutate(midyear = ISOdate(year, 6, 15)))
```
