fpath <- file.path(sibling,fn)

the_data <- read_excel(fpath, col_types = c("numeric", "date", "date",
                                            "numeric","numeric","numeric",
                                            "numeric","numeric","numeric",
                                            "numeric","numeric",
                                            "numeric","numeric",
                                            "numeric","numeric",
                                            "numeric", "numeric","numeric"))
```

Both the "Date" and "Time" columns appear to contain excel date-time
coordinates. The two columns were just were formatted differently in Excel.
However, not all Time entries are consistent.  Some were entered as text, some
as dates, leading to import errors:
```{r}
the_data %>%
  mutate(row = row_number()) %>%
ggplot(aes(Time, row)) + geom_point()
```

Some Times are bare times, with the Excel default "Year zero" in the early 
1900s. Others are complete dates and times.

## Add Manually Created Times
We Create two Date Time values from the Month, Year, Day and Hour Columns, 
with different assumptions about timezone.  We compare them to the datetime
column (originally "date") to see what's going on. That allows us to evaluate
what time coordinates were used.  The challenge here is that we are dealing with
Excel's time handling and date/time formatting, as well as FOCB's data
entry and QA/QC practices.

```{r}
the_data <- the_data %>%
  mutate(DateTime_EST = ISOdatetime(Year, Month, Day, 
                                    Hour, 0, 0, 
                                    tz = 'Etc/GMT-5'),
         DateTime_EST_EDT  = ISOdatetime(Year, Month, Day, 
                                                 Hour, 0, 0, 
                                                 tz = "America/New_York"),
         dt = as.Date(Date)) %>%
  relocate(dt, DateTime_EST, DateTime_EST_EDT, .after = Time) %>%
  relocate(Year, Month, Day, Hour, .after = DateTime_EST_EDT)
```

We delete the first row, which contained units metadata, and modify column 
names because FOCB used non-syntactic names, which are frustrating to work with 
here in R.

```{r}
the_data <- the_data %>%
  slice(-1) %>%
  select(-Time) %>%
  rename_with(.fn = tolower) %>%
  rename(datetime = date,
         depth = `water depth`,
       pctsat = `do%`,
       omega_a = `omega aragonite`)

```

# Evaluating Time Coordinates
There has been some ambiguity in the past about how datetimes were created by
FOCB.  We checkher eto confirm that those problems have been respolved

## Common Timezone Names for Reference
`OlsonNames()` is a function that returns a collection of timezone names that R
can accept.
```{r}
table(sl <- grepl("/", OlsonNames()))

OlsonNames()[ !sl ] # the simple ones, without slashes in the name
```

## Plot Sequential Times
```{r}
ggplot(the_data, aes(datetime)) + 
  geom_point(aes(y =  datetime - datetime_est), color = 'red', alpha = 0.2, size = 0.2) +
  ylab('Difference From Excel Time')
```

That suggest that we are off by as much as a day (60*60*24 seconds), perhaps 
because the datetime conversion is assigning records to the wrong day sometimes.

```{r}
ggplot(the_data, aes(datetime)) + 
  geom_point(aes(y =  datetime - datetime_est_edt), 
             color = 'blue', size = 0.1, alpha = 0.1) +
  ylab('Difference From Excel Time')
```

So, when we convert using clock time the difference between our
constructed times and Excel Date is smaller, but still not zero.  But here 
we are off by SECONDS for the most part.

Data in Excel was stored in clock time, but there are still inconsistencies,
probably because times in Excel has both values and formats, which can lead to 
confusion.

The conclusion is, we need to work wit calculated dates and times, not rely on 
the ones in the Excel spreadsheets.

```{r}
the_data <- the_data %>%
  select(-datetime) %>%
  rename(datetime = datetime_est_edt)
```

## Checking start of DST
Lets look around the start of daylight savings:

2017 	March 12 	November 5  
2018 	March 11 	November 4  

Formally, EDT starts because there is no 2:00 am hour as we switch to EDT.
We confirm that that is true here.
```{r}
the_data %>%
  filter(year == 2017, month == 3, day == 12, hour < 5)
```

```{r}
the_data %>%
  filter(year == 2018, month == 3, day == 11, hour < 5)
```

So FOCB has correctly converted times to clock time.


## Missing Data
Rows 14615  and 14616 correspond to real times, but appear to be empty of
data. Since we have time stamps, we can ignore these rows for most purposes,
relying on R's standard handling of missing values.
```{r}
the_data %>%
  filter(count > 14612, count < 14618)
```

```{r}
which(is.na(the_data$datetime))
```

Are there times separated by more than an hour?  (because times could be
slightly different in the seconds place, we actually search for times 
more than an hour and one minute apart).  We find about 27 gaps in the 
data, where data is missing for a few hours. We show both the record
immediately before the gap and immediately after the gap.

Many gaps appear to start at midnight, and so may reflect dat aQA/QC practices.
```{r}
thespots <- which(the_data$datetime_est - lag(the_data$datetime_est) > 60*61)
before <- thespots - 1

allspots <- c(thespots, before)
allspots <- sort(allspots)
the_data[allspots,]
```

```{r}
the_data <- the_data %>%
  select(-count, -datetime_est)
```

# Evaluating Bimodal Distributions  

* Depth and temperature show strong bimodal distributions.  
* DO shows some bimodal structure, but DOSat does not.  

So, lets  look at those bimodal distributions
```{r}
the_data %>% ggplot(aes(datetime, temperature)) + 
  geom_point()
```

Slicing that by temperature wil lshow higher densities of observations at 
seasonal high and low values, where temperatures do not change as rapidly.

```{r}
monthmeans <- the_data %>% 
        group_by(month) %>% 
        summarise(meantemp = mean(temperature, na.rm = TRUE),
                  mintemp = min(temperature, na.rm = TRUE),
                  maxtemp = max(temperature, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  mutate(monthf = factor(month, levels = as.character(1:12),
                                   labels = c('Jan','Feb','Mar','Apr','May',
                                              'Jun', 'Jul','Aug','Sep','Oct',
                                              'Nov','Dec'))) %>%
  arrange(monthf) %>%
  filter(! is.na(month))

```


WE plot against time shifted by six hours, so the value of zero is six a.m,
which should be about the coolest time of day.
```{r}
ggplot() +
  geom_jitter(data = the_data, aes(x = month,
                                   y = temperature, 
                                   color = (hour + 18)%%24), 
              alpha = 0.25) +
  scale_colour_distiller( type = "div", palette = 1) +
  xlim(0,12) +
    geom_line(data = monthmeans, aes(x = month, y = meantemp), 
              color = 'aquamarine4', lwd = 2) +
    geom_line(data = monthmeans, aes(x = month, y = mintemp), 
              color = 'blue', lwd = 2) +
    geom_line(data = monthmeans, aes(x = month, y = maxtemp), 
              color = 'green', lwd = 2)

```

So, it looks like the bimodal distribution of temperatures reflects the long
periods of the year that are relatively warm (July, August and September) and
relatively cold (Latter half of December, January, February, March).

Lets try to color code by month, and add markers for the monthly means.  The
only trick here was getting the color ramps to assign consistently and
correctly.  Note the use of "arrange" to reorder the dataframes. Apparently,
ggplot assigns colors in order of first appearance of a factor level.
```{r}
the_data %>% mutate(monthf = factor(month, levels = 1:12,
                                   labels = c('Jan','Feb','Mar','Apr','May','Jun',
                                              'Jul','Aug','Sep','Oct','Nov','Dec'))) %>% 
  arrange(monthf) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x =temperature, fill = monthf)) +
  scale_fill_hue(aesthetics = c("colour", "fill")) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, alpha = .5) +
  geom_segment(data = monthmeans,
               aes(x = meantemp, y = 1500,
                   xend = meantemp, yend = 1300,
                   color = monthf),
               lwd = 2, arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.2,"cm"))) 

```

Presumably Depth is bimodal for similar reasons, but perhaps by tidal phase, 
not day or month.

Of course, the problem is that the tidal data does not follow any of the predictor time variables.  We would have to find successive high tides some how...

# Logic for Finding the Time Since High Tide
## Finding High tides in a Record of Water Depths
We are searching for the highest tide within each 15 hour period, and if the
central hour (hour 8 of 15) is the highest tide, we set `localmax` to TRUE.  We
then pad `localmax` to be the same length as the source data, and use if to
index into the source data and figure out what the depth was at that time.
```{r}
tmp <- the_data %>% filter(year == 2017, month == 6)

localmax <- rollapply(tmp$depth, 15, function (x) which.max(x)==8, align = 'center')
localmax <- c(rep(FALSE,7), localmax, c(rep(FALSE,7)))

localmaxdatetime <- tmp$datetime[localmax]
localmaxdepth    <- tmp$depth[localmax]

ggplot() + geom_line(data = tmp, aes(x= datetime, y= depth) ) +
  geom_point(aes(x=localmaxdatetime, y = localmaxdepth), color = 'yellow') +
  scale_x_datetime()
rm(tmp)
```
Pretty cool....

## Finding Times Since Last High
Now that I have a list of the hours nearest successive high tides, We need to 
calculate how long ago the previous high tide was.  We demonstrate the logic 
here using only data internal to the FOCB data, but the same logic can apply 
working with NOAA tide data.  We use the same logic analyzing tidal
relationships with our OA data.

Here's a potentially useful function:
```{r}
findInterval(c(0, 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9), c(2,4,6,8,10))
```
You might think `findInterval()` as a function that assigns
values in the first list to bins defined in the second list.  You might, for
example, use this to define categories or assign values to histogram bars.

For our use, we put the list of all times in the first parameter, and the list
of ONLY high tides in the second parameter, and the function will figure out
which interval (defined by values in the second list) each value in the first
list belongs to.  The function returns a list of the INDEXES of the "closest
but smaller" value in the second list.

```{r}
localmax <- rollapply(the_data$depth, 15, function (x) which.max(x)==8, 
                      align = 'center')
localmax <- c(rep(FALSE,7), localmax, c(rep(FALSE,7)))
the_data$hightide <- localmax     # Add a flag indicating high tides

localmaxdatetime <- the_data$datetime[localmax]
localmaxdepth    <- the_data$depth[localmax]

localmaxdatetime <-  sort(localmaxdatetime)  #Not sure why this needed sorting
                                             # It may reflect missing values?

hightides <- tibble(thetime = localmaxdatetime, depth = localmaxdepth)
```

````{r}
tideindexes <- findInterval(the_data$datetime, hightides$thetime)
tideindexes[tideindexes == 0] = NA  # These occur before the first high tide
head(tideindexes, 100)
```

Those are the only twelve `NA` values in the record.  There is one value
for each time in the_data$datetime.
```{r}
sum(is.na(tideindexes))
```

```{r}
tidetimes =  localmaxdatetime[tideindexes]
head(tidetimes, 50)
```

```{r}
the_data$sincehigh <- as.integer(difftime(the_data$datetime,
                                          tidetimes,units = 'hours'))
```

How'd that work?
```{r}
tmp <- the_data %>% 
  filter (year == 2017, month <6)

ggplot(tmp, aes(sincehigh, depth, color = hightide)) + 
  geom_point()
```
No interval since high tide should be over 13 hours, so we are looking at data
with some impossible values.  They arise because we have some gaps in the data,
creating spacews between high tides that are longer than 13 hours.  Those are not 
meaningful values, but a result of limits in the source data.  They would not
occur with consistent high tide times, as one can get from NOAA.

# Clarifying the Code
Let's apply that to the tides again.
```{r}
tmp <- the_data %>%
  filter(year == 2017, month == 6)
```

```{r}
h <- function(x) ifelse(any(is.na(x)), NA, which(x == max(x))==8)
localmax <- rollapply(tmp$depth, 15, h, align = 'center')

# Pad out the results of rollapply to match the inout vector in length and alignment
localmax = c(rep(FALSE,7), localmax, c(rep(FALSE,7)))

# Now, add datetime and depth to the data frame
localmaxdatetime <- tmp$datetime[localmax]
localmaxdatetime <- localmaxdatetime[!is.na(localmaxdatetime)]
localmaxdepth <- tmp$depth[localmax]
localmaxdepth <- localmaxdepth[!is.na(localmaxdepth)]
```


```{r}
# finally, figure out when the previous high tide occurred
# Identify the index of the previous high tide in `localmaxdatetime`
tideindexes <- findInterval(tmp$datetime, localmaxdatetime)
# Eliminate spurious values before the first high tide
tideindexes[tideindexes== 0] = NA
# Lookup the time that corresponds
tidetimes =  localmaxdatetime[tideindexes]
# Calculate a time difference
tmp$sincehigh <- as.integer(difftime(tmp$datetime,tidetimes,units = 'hours'))
# Any that are more than 13 hours after a high tide must be from a period where some data were missing.
tmp$sincehigh[tmp$sincehigh>13]<- NA
```

```{r}
 ggplot() + geom_line(data = tmp, aes(x= datetime, y= depth) ) +
  geom_point(aes(x=localmaxdatetime, y = localmaxdepth), color = 'Red') +
  scale_x_datetime()

```

Note that there are a couple of High tides, both early and late that we have not 
picked out.  Those are periods with some missing data.

# Constructing Draft Functions
```{r}
h <- function(x) ifelse(any(is.na(x)), NA, which(x == max(x))==8)

  dpth     <- dpth[order(datetime)]
  datetime <- datetime[order(datetime)]
  localmax <- rollapply(dpth, windo, fxn, align = 'center')
  #browser()
  # Pad out the results of rollapply to match the input vector in length
  # Does this need to use `floor()' instead of `as.integer()`?
  # Should this be padded with `NA`?
  localmax = c(rep(FALSE,(as.integer(windo/2))),
                   localmax,
                   rep(FALSE,(as.integer(windo/2)))
